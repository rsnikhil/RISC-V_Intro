This repo contains a slide deck for a basic, general introduction to
RISC-V.  Please feel free to use it for your own teaching.

The slide deck document is written in LaTeX.  Figures included in the
LaTeX are either directly PNGs (e.g., screenshots), or created as SVGs
in Inkscape and converted to PNGs.  The source is processed standardly
via the pdflatex tool.
