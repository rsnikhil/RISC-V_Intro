This repo contains a slide deck for a basic, general introduction to
RISC-V.  Please feel free to use it for your own teaching.

The slide deck is: `RSN_RV_Tute.pdf`

Official RISC-V specifications can be found at: https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/

The slide deck source is LaTeX and is processed standardly via the
`pdflatex` tool.  The main source file is `RSN_RV_Tute.tex`.  Figures
included in the LaTeX are in `Figs/`, and are either directly PNGs
(e.g., screenshots), or created as SVGs in Inkscape and converted to
PNGs (see the `Figs/Makefile` for the conversion script).

To re-generate the PDF, just do:

----
    $ make
----

This will also update SVG->PNG conversions in `Figs/`.
